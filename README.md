# snortsnarf2

By: Ben & Sean

snortsnarf2 is a php re-implementation of the popular snortsnarf perl script program used for parcing snort alert files
and snort mysql databases. 

The idea of this implementation is to create a more efficient implementation using multi-threading
and numerous tools available tools in php that may make live parcing and updating of web content easier

Additionally the hope is to make the source code more easily available, allowing others an opportunity to learn
and understand this popular script

# Setup
Downloading and installing of snortsnarf2 will be described here...eventually. Full documentation on functionality and
use of various tools and how they are implemented on snortsnarf2 will be described in the [wiki page on github](https://github.com/project-terris/snortsnarf2/wiki)

# Versioning
Currently we are in version 0.0.0 as nothing actualy works yet. Version 1.0.0 is defined as the first version where all features from the
previous snortsnarf program have been implemented in snortsnarf2. As features are added, we will be incrementing with the 2nd and 3rd version
numbers depending on the scale of the feature. As bugs are found/fixed and new features are added to snortsnarf2, version numbering will continue
past 1.0.0
